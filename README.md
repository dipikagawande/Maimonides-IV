# Maimonides-IV
- Playing around with the replication data for Angrist and Lavy's seminal 1999 QJE paper, "Using Maimonides' Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size on Scholastic Achievement". (Citation: Joshua D. Angrist, Victor Lavy. 1999. "Using Maimonides' Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size on Scholastic Achievement." The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114(2), 533-575.) This was a brief final project I did for the course "Data Exploration" in my Masters program first semester. 
- Replicating the results of this paper on a small scale helped me gain deeper understanding of the concepts of causal inference, endogeneity and instrumental variable estimation (and appreciation for how difficult it is to find such IVs in the wild). I replicate the figure and analysis for fourth graders only. I do the Instrumental Variable (IV) estimation by writing my own R code for 2-stage least squares regression in Section 4.
